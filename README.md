This is a user-centric static website for Elisabetta Schiavini and Sabrina Cardani, two ceramic artists based in Italy. As the artists are Italian, the website has both an English and Italian version.
It is designed to be responsive on dextop screens, tablets and smartphones. 
Their ceramics and artworks are not expensive and accessible to everyone but the main difference from others common goods is that are personalized, customized and unique.
For this website adopting a B2C strategy, that aims to trigger the customer to an impulsive purchase and follows the rule of three steps to accomplish this, is not appropriate. 
For this reason the website wants to lead the customers to get in touch with the artists through a contact form following a linear and clear path. The website wants to be transparent showing the prices of artworks and ceramic lessons. The main goal of the website is to sell the creations of the artists but at the same time generate an online presence for these two artists and build trust among potential customers or followers on social media pages.
