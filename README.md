### Overview

This is a user-centric static website for Elisabetta Schiavini and Sabrina Cardani, two ceramic artists based in Italy. As the artists are Italian, the website has both an English and Italian version.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (dextop screens, tablets and smartphones). 
Their ceramics and artworks are not expensive and accessible to everyone but the main difference from others common goods is that are personalized, customized and unique.
For this website adopting a B2C strategy, that aims to trigger the customer to an impulsive purchase and follows the rule of three steps to accomplish this, is not appropriate. 
For this reason the website wants to lead the customers to get in touch with the artists through a contact form following a linear and clear path. The website wants to be transparent showing the prices of artworks and ceramic lessons. The main goal of the website is to sell the creations of the artists but at the same time generate an online presence for these two artists and build trust among potential customers or followers on social media pages.

## Strategy
The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the two ceramists leading the users to contact them via email or through their Social Media Pages.

The business goals of this website in order of importance are:
1. Create an online presence for the two local artists and increase their awareness and reputation.
2. Drive potential clients to buy the artworks via a contact form.
3. Lead potential new students to enroll to art classes.
4. Showcase the artists' CV and porfolio to build their trust.
5. Increase number of followers on the artists Social Media Pages.

The customers goals of this website are:
1. View and inspect the artworks, their specifics and prices so they can choose what they like.
2. Watch the lessons programme and book an art lesson. 
3. Place an order quickly, intuitively and easily.

## Scope
I want to offer to the users an overview of the artists mission, artworks and portfolio. The scope of this project is to keep them interested and engaged until they make the decision to get in touch with the artists filling a contact form.
Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:
* clearity
* simplicity
* respect users expectations and confidence

## Structure
In the 'About Us' section is provided a downloadable PDF version of the artists' CV/portfolio that gets opened in another tab.
The paragraphs with contents and information are not too dense and packed.
The structure is easy and linear because wants to lead the users step by step to the 'Contact us' page keeping their attention until that point with a good UX design. 
The footer is constant through the pages and offer links to the artists' Social Media Pages (another way to contact them).

## Surface
**Design Scheme**

It plays with neutral light colours which revoke earth-tones and clay's hues:

* I've chosen a soft pink (#) for backgrounds.
* I've used a gray (#) for body-text to make it outstanding and in contrast.
* I've chosen off-white (#fafafa) for the navigation bar adding a transition (when the mouse hover over the text) that turns it into a darker pink (#).
* I've used a darker gray (#) for headings.

**Typography**
* "Fredericka the Great" font ("Exo" as fallback font) for headings. I've chosen this font for its artistic and clear aspect.
* "Josefin Slab" font ("Montserrat" as fallback font) for body content. I've chosen this font for its elegant design.

**Imagery**

The images have been carefully selected to be eye-catching and appealing. The purpose is to showcase the most recent and important pieces created by the artists.
